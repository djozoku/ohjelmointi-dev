current idea of toolset for ohjelmointi.dev:

firebase for login, storage, database & hosting (might switch this out for passport & typeorm, but what about blob storage & hosting?)
next.js for serverside rendering a react application
apollo for fast and customizeable data fetching
git for version management
gitlab/github for storing project across computers
react for easy to manage single page web application
material ui for good design language
typescript as programming language
markdown for easy cms
draftjs for text editing in browser
react-markdown for markdown conversion to react components
eslint + prettier for code formatting & linting
jest + enzyme for testing
vscode for code editor
heroku for pipelines/testing deployment
commetizen for clean commit messages

workflow:
create new branch for current changes
make changes
push to github
run heroku pipeline
if ok merge to master
host at firebase

system:
nextjs > material ui > clientside react > firebase auth > custom cms > draftjs > custom markdown converter > apollo > typegraphql > firebase firestore > apollo > react-markdown > content
